# tobin.jr
Tobin.Jr is just a small, basic discord bot I have that I coded to help with a linear algebra class.
He returns most commands in images, since numpy matrixes make a new line after each row, so I am drawing them onto a .jpg using PIL.
Any and all help is welcome, let me know what you think :).
